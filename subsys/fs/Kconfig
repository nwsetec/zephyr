	  Each cache buffers a portion of a block in RAM.  The littlefs
	  needs a read cache, a program cache, and one additional cache
	  per file. Larger caches can improve performance by storing
	  more data and reducing the number of disk accesses. Must be a

	  device, and a factor of the block size.

config FS_LITTLEFS_LOOKAHEAD_SIZE

	  A larger lookahead buffer increases the number of blocks found
	  during an allocation pass. The lookahead buffer is stored as a
	  compact bitmap, so each byte of RAM can track 8 blocks. Must
	  be a multiple of 8.

	  For dynamic wear leveling, the number of erase cycles before data
